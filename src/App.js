import React from 'react';
import logo from './logo.svg';
import './App.css';

function App() {
  return (
    <div className="App">
     <p>I am thinking few sections:
        Home, Content, Porfolio, Resume, Contact
       </p> 

    <p>
      Home is a simple image of us 
      with re-adding code on the bottom 
      that switches from student...designer...etc
    </p>

    <p> 
      This can be as easy as a resume 
      or as interesing as a road map 
      of oour Experiences 
    </p>

    <p>
      Portfolio is a list of projects that has hovering capability
      and will route to a new project when clicked
    </p>
    <p>
      Content can pull from our Youtube, Medium, Twitter posts
      in general 
    </p>
    <div> 
      
    </div>
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
